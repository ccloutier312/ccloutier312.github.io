### The Cold War and Word Embeddings: Exploring Gender in the FRUS Series, 1945-1968
The field of US foreign relations has embraced a series of methodological shifts over time. In analyzing the motivations and developments in foreign policy, historians have highlighted a variety of actors and experiences. In recent years, the field of digital humanities has entered the halls of history departments worldwide, bringing with it new tools and techniques. It is because of this development that historians of foreign policy have begun to ask new questions and re-examine the field that has adapted countless times to shifts in the humanities. By using digital methods, scholars may be able to reexamine traditional sources and test existing theories in order to conduct more nuanced analyses. Equipped with new questions and methodologies, historians of foreign relations can re-discover the collections that live in government archives or in digital collections.
